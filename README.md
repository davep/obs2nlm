# obs2nlm - Make a NotebookLM-friendly source from an Obsidian Vault

## Introduction

`obs2nlm` is a simple tool for taking an Obsidian vault and turning it into
a single-file source for use in NotebookLM. This could probably be used for
other things too, but this was my motivation for writing this.
